## Overview

Karima Project, also known as the **Karima Framework**, is a sophisticated external tool designed to integrate directly with the game engine, offering a wide array of advanced features for testing, development, and performance simulation. The framework showcases deep memory management, modular design, dynamic feature toggling, and real-time configuration management.  

The architecture emphasizes flexibility, stability, and modularity. Every feature is implemented as an independent module, allowing users to enable or disable specific functionalities on demand. Karima Framework leverages advanced programming techniques including memory reading and writing, hotkey integration, and runtime configuration updates.  

The framework provides a professional example of how complex external tools are structured, with a focus on scalability, maintainability, and high-performance execution.  

Karima Framework has been optimized for low-latency operations, ensuring seamless integration with runtime environments. Logging and debugging tools are built-in to allow real-time monitoring of all active modules and their states.

## Architecture

The project is organized into multiple layers:

1. **Core Engine**  
   - Handles memory access, module initialization, and event management.  
   - Central hub connecting all modules with runtime monitoring.  

2. **Module System**  
   - Each feature is encapsulated as a self-contained module.  
   - Supports dynamic loading/unloading to minimize resource usage.  

3. **Configuration Layer**  
   - JSON-based configuration with hotkey binding, parameter tuning, and logging options.  
   - Supports runtime reloads for dynamic adjustments.  

4. **Hotkey & Event Manager**  
   - Handles keyboard input and binds keys to module actions.  
   - Allows seamless toggling of multiple modules simultaneously.  

5. **Logging Engine**  
   - Provides detailed runtime logs with timestamps, module states, and error tracking.  

6. **Assets & Resources**  
   - Stores images, configuration templates, and auxiliary files required for framework operation.
