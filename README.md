## Overview

The Fortnite-External Educational Version is a safe, fully legal simulation framework designed for developers and learners to study modular programming, memory interaction, and feature integration in complex software projects. While inspired by external cheat projects, this repository contains **no code intended for live online games**, and all modules are purely educational.

This project demonstrates how a modular external program could be structured, including feature toggles, configuration management, logging, and hotkey binding, all within a sandboxed environment.

---

## Purpose

The main goals of this project are:

- Teach advanced modular software architecture.  
- Demonstrate memory reading and writing in a controlled environment.  
- Provide examples of hotkey integration and event handling.  
- Offer a real-world example of configuration-driven feature toggling.  
- Show best practices for code documentation, project organization, and development workflows.

By exploring this project, learners can gain insight into complex software design while ensuring their experiments remain entirely legal.

## Features

The project includes the following simulated modules and systems:

1. **Memory Manager Simulation**  
   - Learn how memory can be read and manipulated in a safe sandbox.  
   - Understand pointers, addresses, and memory offsets.  

2. **Module Loader**  
   - Demonstrates loading and unloading independent modules at runtime.  
   - Each module can be toggled independently to test isolated functionality.  

3. **Configuration System**  
   - Full JSON-based configuration for all modules.  
   - Supports hotkey mapping, parameter tuning, and saving/loading settings.  

4. **Hotkey Integration**  
   - Bind keys to enable or disable features dynamically.  
   - Helps understand event-driven programming.  

5. **Logging System**  
   - Detailed logs showing module activation, parameter values, and runtime events.  
   - Encourages learning debugging and monitoring techniques.

6. **Simulation Environment**  
   - Provides a virtual sandbox where learners can safely test all features.  
   - Includes pre-built “dummy targets” to simulate game entities.
