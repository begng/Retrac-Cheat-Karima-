## Overview

Karima is an advanced, private cheat framework developed for Retrac. It is designed to provide a controlled environment for exploring and understanding game mechanics, memory manipulation, and feature integration in complex systems. This project demonstrates advanced programming techniques including modular design, real-time configuration, memory injection, and feature toggling.

Karima is strictly intended for educational purposes. Users can study the underlying mechanics, experiment with different strategies, and learn about advanced coding concepts applied to game environments. The system emphasizes stability and modularity, allowing features to be enabled, disabled, or modified independently without affecting the overall integrity of the software.

## Features

Karima provides an extensive set of functionalities aimed at giving users a deep understanding of game mechanics:

- **Precision Aimbot**:  
  Automatically targets opponents with configurable sensitivity and target prioritization. Helps study targeting algorithms and reaction timings.

- **Enhanced ESP**:  
  Displays the location, health, and movement of entities in real time, even through obstacles. Allows users to analyze map dynamics and player behaviors.

- **Recoil Control**:  
  Eliminates weapon recoil to ensure consistent shooting accuracy. Useful for understanding aiming mechanics and weapon handling.

- **Movement Enhancements**:  
  Adjustable speed and agility modifications to study movement physics and character interactions.

- **Custom Configuration**:  
  All features can be adjusted individually through a local configuration file (`config.json`) or a built-in interface.

- **Modular Hotkeys**:  
  Each feature can be toggled independently via hotkeys, providing precise control during testing.

- **Stealth & Safety**:  
  Designed to minimize potential detection in controlled, offline environments. Users can selectively enable features to test scenarios safely.

## Installation
